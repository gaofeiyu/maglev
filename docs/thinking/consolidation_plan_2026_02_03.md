# Thinking Documents Consolidation Plan

## Problem
Too many fragmented "Thinking" folders created in a short session (`openspec`, `fix_reverse`, `reverse_audit`, `create_spec_audit`, `create_prd_audit`). This creates noise and makes history tracking difficult.

## Solution
Consolidate all "Fortification" and "Standardization" work from 2026-02-03 into a single Milestone Folder.

### Target Directory
`docs/thinking/2026-02-03-maglev-fortification/`

### Migration Map

| Original Folder | New File in Target |
| :--- | :--- |
| `openspec_adoption_2026_02_03` | `01_openspec_adoption.md` |
| `fix_reverse_archival_2026_02_03` | `02_fix_reverse_archival.md` |
| `reverse_spec_audit_2026_02_03` | `03_reverse_spec_audit.md` |
| `create_spec_audit_2026_02_03` | `04_create_spec_audit.md` |
| `create_prd_audit_2026_02_03` | `05_create_prd_audit.md` |

### Actions
1.  Create new folder.
2.  Move `implementation_plan.md` from each source to the target as the new filename.
3.  (Optional) Merge `task.md` lists into a single `master_task.md` or keep them as apendices.
4.  Delete old folders.
5.  Update `docs/thinking/README.md` with a single entry.

## Output
A unified view of the "Maglev Fortification" milestone.
